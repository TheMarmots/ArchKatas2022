# Architectural Kata: Summer 2022

Welcome to the repository holding our solution to O'Reilly Architectural Katas - Summer 2022. We are a group of application security development and automation engineers, who are passionate about building secure software, right from its design.

At work, we are proud to be a part of an organization that believes in enabling and contributing to social responsibilities through non-profit organizations. Along with a scalable, extensible and reliable architecture, our team brings the same passion to the software that we are building in this Kata.
