# Architectural Kata: Summer 2022: Spotlight App

## Introduction
Everyone deserves a chance to be in a career they aspire and can grow in. In the competitive job market today, under-represented communities often miss out on opportunities due to lack of facilities like training, education and career mentorship.  Diversity Cyber Council is a 501c3 Non-Profit that serves such demographics in the tech industry by facilitating several opportunities to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline to the workforce. The vision is to enhance inclusion and representation in the tech industry through training, mentoring, networking, and visibility programs.

The Spotlight app project is being built with a goal to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline that extends career equity to underrepresented demographics by providing access to competent training programs that lead to direct employment opportunities. The sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities involves developing a centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate, network and make a collective impact, thereby, illuminating possibilities.

## Our Strategy

Most modern applications today are built with smaller, nimble components that allow them to achieve speed, scalability and security in their operations. Looking at the goal with which Spotlight App Project is being built, extensibility is also going to be one of the important characteristics. Our strategy in designing the initial architecture for Spotlight is to enable key features that drive the main purpose of the project, pay deliberate attention to the security aspects and architectural elements, such that they can support changing, long-term needs.

*Side Note: As this is the first time that our team participated in the Katas event, our work here is inspired by previous winners: TheJedis2020 (https://github.com/TheJedis2020) and The Archangels (https://tekiegirl.github.io/Archangels/).*
