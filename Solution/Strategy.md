# Our Strategy
---

Most modern applications today are built with smaller, nimble components that allow them to achieve speed, scalability and security in their operations. Looking at the goal with which Spotlight App Project is being built, extensibility is also going to be one of the important characteristics. Our strategy in designing the initial architecture for Spotlight is to enable key features that drive the main purpose of the project, pay deliberate attention to the security aspects and architectural elements, such that they can support changing, long-term needs.

*Side Note: As this is the first time that our team participated in the Katas event, our work here is inspired by previous winners: TheJedis2020 (https://github.com/TheJedis2020) and The Archangels (https://tekiegirl.github.io/Archangels/).*
