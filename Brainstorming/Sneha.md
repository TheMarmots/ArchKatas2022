Read Josiah's notes and added only additional points below. 

## Use Cases

### Administrators
1. Ability to establish legitimacy of service providers
2. Ability to onboard legit service providers/trainers onto the platform
3. Ability for candidate and non-profit to build and save a learning/activity path for multi-session services

### Candidates
1. Ability to view samples of offering to decide about enrollment
2. Ability to connect with trainers/service providers

### Other considerations
1. Have ML feature to the backend to provide better matching capabiltiies. 
2. This will require availability and processing of large amount of data - data storage, mining and training the models will also become part of the consideration
3. Benefits: improving accuracy of match --> better candidate experience, performanace improvements behind the scenes in matching modules
