# Actors, Actions & Significant Scenarios

The Actors on the system (typically the human users but can also include other systems) and the actions they take help to form the key scenarios, or flows, of the system. The following identifies the significant actors, actions and key scenarios that will inform the architecture of the Farmacy Family system.

## Actors & Actions

The identified actors their actions are as follows:

| Actor                  | Actions                                                      |
