# Diagram Assets

## How the diagrams were made
All diagrams were created using LucidChart (https://lucid.app/). A .vsdx file is also included for each diagram within the diagramSource folder, which you can use to edit or update a diagram using LucidChart or Microsoft Visio. See https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tour/visio_viewer.


## A note about SVG files
SVG files should have clickable links on ADR symbols, allowing you to view the related ADR. This only works when viewing the raw file on GitHub however, as the links are sanitized by default in regular GitHub pages.
